# 🌌 Aurora: Safety That Listens

> *"Help."*  
> That’s all you should have to say.

We built **Aurora** because sometimes, pressing a button isn’t possible.  
Sometimes, your hands are tied.  
Your phone is out of reach.  
Or you’re just… too afraid to make a sound.

But your voice is still yours.  
And **Aurora listens**.

---

##  What Is Aurora?

A **voice-activated safety system** that turns a single word into a lifeline.

Say *"help"* — and Aurora:
1.  Starts recording your surroundings
2.  Logs the event with timestamp and location
3.  Saves it securely — offline, private, forever
4.  (Coming soon) Alerts your trusted contacts

No app open. No button press.  
Just **your voice**, when you need it most.

##  Why We Built This

We were inspired by real stories:
- A student walking home alone at night
- A caregiver worried about their aging parent
- A survivor who couldn’t reach their phone

We asked:  
> _What if safety didn’t require a tap?_  
> _What if it just… listened?_

So we built **Aurora** — for the quiet moments, the dangerous ones, the ones where help is just a whisper away.

---

## How It Works

1. You say: **"help"** (or any keyword you choose)
2. Aurora wakes up — no unlock, no delay
3. It records everything until silence
4. The audio is saved to your device
5. An alert is logged in a secure local database

All offline.  
All private.  
All yours.

##  Who Is This For?

-  A parent who wants to protect their child
-  A caregiver monitoring an elderly loved one
-  A student walking home late at night
-  A survivor reclaiming their sense of safety
-  Anyone who believes: **help should be easy**

Aurora isn’t just for those in crisis.  
It’s for everyone who’s ever felt unsafe — and didn’t know what to do.

## 🌍 The Future of Aurora

We’re just getting started. Next:
- 📞 Auto-alert your emergency contacts
- 📍 Live location sharing
- 🧠 AI to detect distress in your voice
- 🎧 Wearable integration (panic button)
- 🌐 Multilingual support

Because safety shouldn’t depend on your phone, your network, or your courage.

The best safety tools aren’t built in silence.  
They’re built **with** people, **for** people.

##  A Note From the Team

> "We don’t know what kind of moment will bring someone to Aurora.  
> But we know this:  
> In that moment, they shouldn’t have to do more than speak.  
> We built Aurora so they don’t have to."
